# BMI_calculator
A basic BMI(Body Mass Index) calculator which helps in the measuring of the health of a person based on their weight and height. 
In this model, I used java script for storing the data in the local server in the period of developing the code. 
This model uses a local host server to store the initialized data of the user's weight and height. 
At final, the model calculates the result based on the formula BMI(Body Mass Index)=weight/(height*height).
